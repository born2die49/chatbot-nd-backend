# In a real-world application, you would define Celery tasks here
# For example:
# 
# from celery import shared_task
# 
# @shared_task
# def embed_document_chunks(vector_store_id, document_id):
#     """Celery task to embed document chunks and add them to a vector store."""
#     from .services.vector_store_manager import VectorStoreManager
#     
#     try:
#         manager = VectorStoreManager()

#         logger.exception(f"Failed to embed document chunks: {str(e)}")
#         raise

# For now, we'll leave this file mostly empty since we're not implementing Celery
